## 💡 Problem  
Preparing for surgery is **stressful**, **confusing**, and **time-sensitive**.

Patients are expected to follow strict pre-operative instructions — fasting windows, medication pauses, skin preparation, arrival times — yet:

- Instructions are often delivered as *static PDFs*, letters, or verbal explanations.  
- Patients lose or forget important steps.  
- Confusion leads to unnecessary phone calls, incorrect preparation, or even surgery cancellations.  
- Clinicians spend countless hours responding to easily-preventable questions.

**The result:** anxiety for patients, inefficiencies for clinical teams, and real risk to surgical safety.


## 🚀 Our Solution  
We built **Pre-Op Companion**, a smart, interactive, and reassuring experience that brings pre-operative preparation into the modern era.

### ✅ 1. Smart, Timely Notifications
Patients receive automated reminders exactly when they need them —  
when to stop medication, when fasting begins, when to use prep solution, and when to head to the hospital.

No guessing. No missed steps.


### 📝 2. Interactive Pre-Op Checklist
A clean, patient-friendly interface shows everything they need to do, in the right order, with time-specific guidance.

Patients can check off items at their convenience and review what’s coming next.  
Clinicians gain peace of mind that patients are better prepared.


### 💬 3. Conversational AI Surgical Companion
Patients can ask any question in natural language:

- “Why do I need to stop eating at midnight?”  
- “What does skin prep solution actually do?”  
- “When should I take my last dose of Apixaban?”  
- “What happens if I catch a cold before surgery?”  

The AI provides **clear, reassuring, layperson-friendly answers**, reducing unnecessary clinical calls and boosting confidence.


## ❤️ Why This Is Important  
**One cancelled surgery can cost a hospital thousands of pounds.**  
Most cancellations stem from preventable preparation errors:

- taking medications too close to the procedure  
- not fasting properly  
- misunderstanding instructions  
- showing up late or unprepared  

For patients, these steps are not “admin.” They are **stress points**, amplified by fear and uncertainty.

Our solution:

- increases compliance  
- reduces last-minute cancellations  
- improves patient safety  
- saves nursing teams and surgical coordinators hours  
- gives patients a sense of agency and calm in a vulnerable moment  

It turns complex medical instructions into a guided, supportive experience.


## 📱 Walkthrough  

### 👤 Patient Dashboard  
Shows key identifiers (NHS ID, Hospital ID), procedure details, surgeon/contact info, and a simple explanation of the operation.

### 🗂 Pre-Op Checklist  
Tasks are time-anchored and colour-coded:

- ✓ Stop Apixaban 48 hours before op  
- ▢ Nil by mouth from midnight  
- ▢ Skin preparation at 06:00  
- ▢ Arrival at hospital at 07:00  

Tapping an item expands details and rationale.

### 🔔 Smart Reminders  
Patients receive prompts at exactly the right moment:  
“Your fasting window begins in 30 minutes — would you like a quick explanation of what counts as clear fluids?”

### 🌟 Ask AI Button  
A floating “Ask AI” action opens an embedded chat where the patient can:

- clarify medical jargon  
- check symptoms  
- understand risks  
- request summaries in simple language  
- get reassurance and instructions instantly  

This reduces reliance on busy phone lines and ensures patients feel supported at all times.
